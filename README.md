🏥 CareData Portal
Smart Health Quality Indicator & Reporting Platform
(Aligned with Australian Government Health API Standards)
Developed by Team W08 – University of Wollongong
📘 Overview
CareData Portal is a modern web-based system that simplifies the collection, management, and reporting of Quality Indicator (QI) data for aged-care and healthcare facilities. It helps organizations monitor performance, visualize insights, and generate AI-based recommendations that align with Australian Government Health API standards.
The project supports data exchange principles inspired by the Australian Government Health Developer Portal (https://developer.health.gov.au/), promoting secure interoperability and FHIR-compliant data practices.
